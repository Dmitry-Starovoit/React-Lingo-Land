          You need to learn English with those films that you like. Because when
          watching your favorite movie you do not get tired , and it allows for
          in-depth language learning. While watching the movie you will learn a
          lot of phrases , idioms and interesting words that will come in handy.
          Understanding English by ear is one of the main stages of learning a
          language. You need to get used to perceiving by ear, since familiar
          words do not always sound from the carrier , as expected. With your
          favorite movie, you will significantly increase your level of
          knowledge. Understanding English is now very important. If you are
          just a beginner in learning English language, you can watch with
          subtitles , but do not abuse the subtitles. After watching a piece of
          the film , write out the words you do not know and study them, how and
          where they are used, with what intonation and stress.
